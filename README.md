# ghidraMCP
ghidraMCP is an Model Context Protocol server for allowing LLMs to autonomously reverse engineer applications. It exposes numerous tools from core Ghidra functionality to MCP clients.

# Features
MCP Server + Ghidra Plugin

- Decompile and analyze binaries in Ghidra
- Automatically rename methods and data
- List methods, classes, imports, and exports

# Installation

## Prerequisites
- Install [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org)
- Python3
- MCP [SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)

## Ghidra
First, download the latest [release](https://github.com/LaurieWired/GhidraMCP/releases) from this repository. This contains the Ghidra plugin and Python MCP client. Then, you can directly import the plugin into Ghidra.

1. Run Ghidra
2. Select `File` -> `Install Extensions`
3. Click the `+` button
4. Select the `GhidraMCP-1-2.zip` (or your chosen version) from the downloaded release
5. Restart Ghidra
6. Make sure the GhidraMCPPlugin is enabled in `File` -> `Configure` -> `Developer`
7. *Optional*: Configure the port in Ghidra with `Edit` -> `Tool Options` -> `GhidraMCP HTTP Server`

## MCP Clients

Theoretically, any MCP client should work with ghidraMCP.  Three examples are given below.

## Example 1: Claude Desktop
To set up Claude Desktop as a Ghidra MCP client, go to `Claude` -> `Settings` -> `Developer` -> `Edit Config` -> `claude_desktop_config.json` and add the following:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ghidra": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "/ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO/bridge_mcp_ghidra.py",
        "--ghidra-server",
        "http://127.0.0.1:8080/"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, edit this file directly:
```
/Users/YOUR_USER/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

The server IP and port are configurable and should be set to point to the target Ghidra instance. If not set, both will default to localhost:8080.

## Example 2: Cline
To use GhidraMCP with [Cline](https://cline.bot), this requires manually running the MCP server as well. First run the following command:

```
python bridge_mcp_ghidra.py --transport sse --mcp-host 127.0.0.1 --mcp-port 8081 --ghidra-server http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```

The only *required* argument is the transport. If all other arguments are unspecified, they will default to the above. Once the MCP server is running, open up Cline and select `MCP Servers` at the top.

![Cline select](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88e1f336-4729-46ee-9b81-53271e9c0ce0)

Then select `Remote Servers` and add the following, ensuring that the url matches the MCP host and port:

1. Server Name: GhidraMCP
2. Server URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8081/sse`

## Example 3: 5ire
Another MCP client that supports multiple models on the backend is [5ire](https://github.com/nanbingxyz/5ire). To set up GhidraMCP, open 5ire and go to `Tools` -> `New` and set the following configurations:

1. Tool Key: ghidra
2. Name: GhidraMCP
3. Command: `python /ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO/bridge_mcp_ghidra.py`

# Building from Source

The build is tied to one specific Ghidra install: it compiles against that
install's jars and stamps that install's version into `extension.properties`,
which Ghidra checks before it will load an extension at all. The scripts in
`scripts/` read both out of the install so nothing has to be edited by hand
when you upgrade Ghidra or build on a second machine.

```sh
./scripts/setup-libs.sh          # copy the 9 Ghidra jars into lib/ (once per install)
./scripts/build.sh               # compile + package, stamped with that install's version
./scripts/install.sh             # symlink into the per-user extensions dir
```

Each script takes an optional install path and otherwise auto-detects one, in
this order: `$GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR`, the `lastrun` file Ghidra writes on launch,
then conventional locations (`/Applications`, `/opt`, `$HOME`). To target a
different install, pass it explicitly:

```sh
./scripts/setup-libs.sh /opt/ghidra_12.1_PUBLIC
./scripts/build.sh      /opt/ghidra_12.1_PUBLIC
./scripts/install.sh    /opt/ghidra_12.1_PUBLIC
```

`install.sh` symlinks `target/GhidraMCP.jar` and `bridge_mcp_ghidra.py` back to
the repo, so after the first install the edit loop is `./scripts/build.sh` plus
a Ghidra restart. Pass `--copy` for a standalone install; that is the default on
Windows, where symlinks need elevation.

Switching a checkout between Ghidra versions means re-running `setup-libs.sh`,
since `lib/` holds jars from whichever install you last pointed it at.

## Building without the scripts

`mvn package` on its own deliberately produces an unloadable zip: `ghidraVersion`
comes from the `ghidra.version` property, which defaults to a placeholder. Pass
the real version to get a working one, after populating `lib/` yourself:

```sh
mvn -Dghidra.version=11.4.1 clean package assembly:single
```

The generated zip contains what Ghidra needs to recognize the extension:

- `GhidraMCP/lib/GhidraMCP.jar`
- `GhidraMCP/extension.properties`
- `GhidraMCP/Module.manifest`
